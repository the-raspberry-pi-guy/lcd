# Driver library for LCD display. Provided by Ryanteck LTD.
# The procedures below can all be called in your own code!
# You can just stick to the print string one though ;-)

# This is the driver library for the LCD display
# It contains some functions that you can call in your own program
# Just remember that in order to use it you have to import it
# You can do that with the line: import lcddriver
# Make sure that lcddriver is in the same directory though!
# Credit for this code goes to "natbett" of the Raspberry Pi Forum 18/02/13
