# LCD
This repository contains all the code for interfacing with a **16x2 character I2C liquid-crystal display (LCD)**. This accompanies my **Youtube tutorial**: [Raspberry Pi - Mini LCD Display Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR5XhHYzUK0). 

You can buy one of these great little I2C LCD on eBay or somewhere like [the Pi Hut](https://thepihut.com/search?type=product&q=lcd).

# Installation
* Install git
  ``` 
  sudo apt install git
  ```

* Clone the repo in your `pi` home directory
  ``` 
  cd /home/pi/
  git clone https://github.com/the-raspberry-pi-guy/lcd.git
  cd lcd/
  ```

* Run the automatic installation script with `sudo` permission
  ``` 
  sudo ./install.sh
  ```

* After rebooting, try one of the [**demos**](#demos)
  ``` 
  cd /home/pi/lcd/
  ./demo_clock.py
  ```

# Demos
## Simple strings
This is a demo developed by user @Tomtom0201, showing how simple text stings could be displayed on LCD:

</p>


## Extended strings
This is a demo debeloped by @juvus, showing how extended strings could be used. Extended strings can contain special placeholders `{0xFF}` - hex code of the symbol wrapped with curly bracers. Hex code of the symbol can be found in characters table. For example code of the symbol `รถ` is 0xEF, and so this symbol could be printed by using `{0xEF}` placeholder in string. Table can be found in `/imgs/characters_table.png`.
If you want to combine placeholder to write a symbol {0xFF} with native python placeholder {0} for inserting dome data into text, escape those placeholders that is using to write a symbol. This is an example:
 `display.lcd_display_extended_string("Symbol:{{0xEF}} data:{0}".format(5), 2)`

## Custom characters
It is possible to define in CG RAM memory 8 absolutelly custom characters. This characters can be pronted on LCD the same way as any characters from the character table. Codes of the custom characters are unique and the following: 1st - {0x00}, 2nd - {0x01}, 3rd - {0x02}, 4th - {0x03}, 5th - {0x04}, 6th - {0x05}, 7th - {0x06} and 8th - {0x07}. Please, see the `demo_lcd_custom_characters.py` file for more details, how it is possible to define you own characters. This demo was debeloped by @juvus.

## Progress bar
This is a demo of graphical progress bar created with custom characters. This bar could be used, for example, for showing the current level of battery charge. This demo was debeloped by @juvus.

## Backlight Control
This is a demo developed by user and watcher @Tomtom0201, showcasing backlight control of the LCD (available on some hardware):

## Forex
This is a demo developed by user and watcher @bariskisir.  It requires `python-pip` and the packages `requests` and `bs4` (BeautifulSoup) because it parses web content.

* Install `pip`
  ```
  sudo apt install python-pip
  ```
* Then install `requests` and `bs4`
  ```
  pip install requests bs4
  ```
* Now you should be able to run `demo_forex.py`:

I haven't been able to test it myself personally, but it looks like a cool Forex stream. If you run into any bugs with it, please feel free to reach out to bariskisir and submit a PR.

## IP Address
Another demo developed by @Sierra007117:

Display your Pi's IP address - useful for SSH'ing and more!


## NetMonitor
A demo created by [@cgomesu](https://github.com/cgomesu) that uses `ping` and `nc` (netcat) to monitor the network status of hosts and services, respectively.  This demo uses built-in tools, so nothing new needs to be installed.

<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/demo_netmonitor.gif">
</p>

Hosts and services can be modified by editing their respective [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries):

```python
hosts = {
    'Internet': '8.8.8.8',
    'Firewall': '192.168.1.1',
    'NAS': '192.168.1.2'
}
services = {
    'Cameras': {'ip': '192.168.1.2', 'port': '8000'},
    'Plex': {'ip': '192.168.1.2', 'port': '32400'}
}
```

After editing the hosts and services dictionaries, you can run this demo in the background (as a service) as follows:
1. Create a new service file in `/lib/systemd/system/` called `rpi-netmonitor.service`:
```commandline
nano /lib/systemd/system/rpi-netmonitor.service
```
2. Copy and paste the following in the new service file:
```
[Unit]
Description=A RPi network monitor for a 16x2 LCD

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi

ExecStart=/usr/bin/python /home/pi/rpi-lcd/demo_netmonit.py

Restart=always
RestartSec=5

KillMode=process
KillSignal=SIGINT

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
3. Enable the service and start it:
```commandline
sudo systemctl enable rpi-netmonitor.service
sudo systemctl start rpi-netmonitor.service
```
4. Check that the LCD is displaying the correct information; otherwise, check the service status
```commandline
sudo systemctl status rpi-netmonitor.service
```
## Daily dashboard 
Created by [@jdarias](https://github.com/jdarias). This is a script that shows the last three characters from your ip address, the date in DDMM format and the hour in HH:MM format
<p align="center">
  <img src="imgs/demo_iphour.gif">
</p>
It also takes info from the following apis and shows it in the 16\*2 display.

* [theysaidso.com](https://theysaidso.com): Free public API that provides famous quotes from well known people. It has a public endpoint that doesn't require an API key.

* [exchangerate-api.com](https://exchangerate-api.com) / [free.currencyconverterapi.com](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com): There are a lot of currency apis but these ones offer free currency exchange info. Both are used, one as main, the other as backup.

* [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org): Provides Weather info, forecasts, etc.

In order to use the script you need to get API key tokens for both exchange rate services and the weather api. Open the script in a text editor and put your tokens in the USER VARIABLES section.

Also set a currency exchange pair. For currency support and the currency codes you need to use, see [Here](https://free.currencyconverterapi.com) for free.currencyconverter.com (click the "List of all currencies" link) and [Here](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/docs/supported-currencies) for exchangerate-api.com

A city/country string is also needed to show weather info for such city. Search for your city on openweathermap.org and take note of the name,country and put it in the script. London,gb is given as an example.
